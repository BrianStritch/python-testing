'''
When the test was run this function call was also run.
Letâ€™s prevent that from happening by making  the following change.
So what is this doing? To keep it  simple, when Python runs a file directly,
it names it __main__ and any code  beneath the if statement will only be run
if the name of the file is __main__.
